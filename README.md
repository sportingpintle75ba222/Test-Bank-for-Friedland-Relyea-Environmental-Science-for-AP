  * Friedland/Relyea Environmental Science for AP\* was written specifically for the AP\* Environmental Science (APES) course, directly addressing the needs of APES students and teachers from beginning to end.  Lead author Dr. Andrew Friedland of Dartmouth College was the founding Chair of the College Board committee that created the APES course. He regularly teaches Introduction to Environmental Science at Dartmouth and is actively researching environmental science topics related to air pollution and carbon accumulation in forests.  The Friedland package uniquely prepares students for the quantitative aspects of the APES course in a way no other text does. In addition, it explores and explains every topic within the APES course description while offering a scientific and balanced approach to the key concepts.   The Friedland text is praised for its accessibility and for familiarizing students with the findings that inform environmental decision making at all levels—from personal choice to national and international policy.
